        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>When we read a good book we often wish to find out what happened next.</p>
        <p>And often the authors have answered these questions in another book. However, these sequels can be obscure or 
        out of print or hard to find. Many of us have taken a book home to enjoy, only to find that the rest of the story was out of print, and available in the
        public library or a used book fair if we were lucky. Robert Louis Stevenson's <i>Kidnapped</i> is far more famous (and easier to find) than its sequel <i>Catriona</i>. 
        The <i>Princess and the Goblin</i> is a wonderful and famous story, but that story is completed in the lesser-known work, <i>The Princess and
        Curdie</i>.</p>
