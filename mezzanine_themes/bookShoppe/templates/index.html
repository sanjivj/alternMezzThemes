    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>We often wish to find out what happened next; did the promising youth turn out well? Did the boy get the girl? And so forth.</p>
    <p>And often our favorite authors have answered these questions in the form of sequels. However, these sequels can be obscure or 
    out of print. Robert Louis Stevenson's Kidnapped is far more famous (and easier to find) than its sequel Catriona. 
    The Princess and the Goblin is a wonderful and famous story, but that story is completed in the lesser-known work, The Princess and
    Curdie. Many of us have taken a book home to enjoy, only to find that the rest of the story was out of print, and available in the
    public library if we were lucky.</p>

    <h2>The Solution</h2>
    <p>At The Whole Story, we stock sequels and prequels to your favorite works. You can buy omnibus editions as well as boxed sets, 
    or just buy the stories in a series one by one! Our promise to you is that we will have the next book in the series. </p>
